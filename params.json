{"name":"CS-101","tagline":"Coding, Part Zero","body":"### CS-101\r\nThe basics of coding involve learning to do the simple things in life. From scratch. When learning to code it's therefore not just important to know which library command takes the square root of a number, or which method appends an item onto the end of a list. No, you must learn how to do those things _from scratch_. Welcome to Level 0.\r\n\r\n### Square Roots\r\nImagine you are a computer living peacefully in Computer Land and imagine that your skills are extremely limited: for loops, while loops, multiplication, division (etc) you can do no problem. But in the Computer Land you are in you have no predefined functions or libraries. How do you find the square root of a number? You use a root finding algorithm such as the [Newton-Rhapson method](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsMethod.html)\r\n\r\nFind the order of magnitude of the answer to seed your guess\r\n```\r\n# order of magnitude for seed guess\r\n p = float(argv[1])\r\n remainder = p\r\n orderOfMagnitude = 1\r\n while remainder >= 10:\r\n          remainder = remainder/10\r\n          orderOfMagnitude += 1\r\n\r\n orderOfMagnitude /= 2\r\n guess = 10**orderOfMagnitude\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplement the root finding algorithm\r\n```\r\n# calculate sqrt() \r\n while error > epsilon:\r\n          guess = .5*guess + .5*p/guess\r\n          error = abs(p-guess**2)\r\n\r\n print '\\n',guess, guess**2,'\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n// work in progress.. //","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
